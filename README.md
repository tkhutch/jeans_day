# Jeans Day

A popular way for companies to raise money for charity is to allow employees to pay a small fee to wear jeans to work. This demo app built on the Salesforce Platform provides a simple way for employees to sign up to wear jeans on a particular day so that program administrators know from whom to collect money. Note that this is *not* a production ready app at this point, it's intended as a demonstration of a simple app that can be built on Salesforce that all employees at a company might use, rather than something only for the sales or service teams.

## Installation Instructions

Coming soon! Though if you're fluent with SFDX, you may be good (assuming I did this right.)
